<p>Overriding a method and invoking the same method on the superclass is core
   technique in object-oriented programming. It's great: you automatically preserve the
   behavior of the superclass now and in the future. In JavaScript, the most straight forward way
   is to refer to the superclass's method directly and use <code>apply()</code> to pass it
   the current scope and arguments:
</p>
<pre><code>function Wagon() {}
subclass(Wagon, Vehical, {
    drive: function() {
        this.moveForward(3);
    }
});

function RickityWagon() {}
subclass(RickityWagon, Wagon, {
    drive: function() {
        this.clatter();
        return Wagon.prototype.drive.apply(this, arguments);
    }
});
</code></pre><p>No matter how Wagon's <code>drive()</code> method evolves - adding more complex
   logic, calling other methods, adding option arguments, returning a value
   - RickityWagon's <code>drive()</code> method will always behave the same way, just
   with additional clattering.
</p>
<p>It may seem strange to refer to the superclass directly if you come to Java,
   but that's perfectly natural for those of us coming from C++. You see, in C++ you can have multiple
   base classes, so <code>super.method</code> is ambiguous, so you have to say which
   class you mean.
</p>
<p>So that's superclass chaining. Pretty much everyone agrees that it's a good
   thing.  Some people, however, think the obvious way, 
   <code>return SuperClass.prototype.method.apply(this, arguments)</code>, is too verbose and go looking for an easier way. I'd like to discuss of few of those approaches and why they don't quite work, and argue for sticking to the simple, explicit, and obvious way.
</p>
<p>The first thing you'd think of is to put a <code>super</code> property on the class's prototype, so you
   could say something like <code>this.super.drive</code>. Unfortunately, this breaks down
   for more than one level of inheritance. If you call up to a superclass, and it
   tries to call up to <em>it's</em> superclass, it will end up calling back into itself,
   causing an infinite loop.
</p>

<h2>Resig's _super()</h2>
<p>John Resig attacks this problem directly in his <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/">Class.extend utility</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>prototype[name] = typeof prop[name] == &quot;function&quot; &amp;&amp; 
    typeof _super[name] == &quot;function&quot; &amp;&amp; fnTest.test(prop[name]) ?
    (function(name, fn){
      return function() {
        var tmp = this._super;

        // Add a new ._super() method that is the same method
        // but on the super-class
        this._super = _super[name];

        // The method only need to be bound temporarily, so we
        // remove it when we're done executing
        var ret = fn.apply(this, arguments);        
        this._super = tmp;

        return ret;
      };
    })(name, prop[name]) :
    prop[name];
</code></pre><p>His approach is very direct: when you call <code>_super</code>, swap out <code>_super</code> on the
   parent temporarily, and then put it back when you're done. Which is great,
   unless <code>fn</code> throws an exception, in which case it doesn't get put back.  You
   could put a try/catch/rethrow around it, but that usually drops important stack
   trace information from the exception.
</p>

<h2>Using <code>caller</code></h2>
<p>There's another interesting way to implement <code>super</code>: relying on
   <code>arguments.callee.caller</code>. Using that, you could implemnt a <code>superApply</code> method
   that you call like so:
</p>
<pre><code>function RickityWagon() {}
subclass(RickityWagon, Wagon, {
    drive: function() {
        this.clatter();
        return this.superApply(arguments);
    }
});
</code></pre><p><code>superApply</code> could use <code>arguments.callee.caller</code> to get a reference to the
   method it's inside, which you could link back to the overridden method on the
   superclass if you set up a link when creating the class. Let's say you detect
   overridden methods at class creation at set a <code>parentMethod</code> property on the
   overriding method. The <code>superApply</code> could be implemented as:
</p>
<pre><code>function superApply(args) {
    var pm = arguments.callee.caller.parentMethod;
    if ( pm ) return pm.apply(this, args);
}
</code></pre><p>There are a couple of problems with that. First of all, <code>caller</code> is deprecated:
   you really shouldn't be using it at all, and especially not for some merely convenient syntactic sugar.
   If an environment drops support for it altogether (and many JavaScript engines <strong>already</strong> provide a
   faster &quot;strict&quot; mode where <code>callee</code> is not supported) you'll have to change a <em>lot</em> of code
   to get it working again.
</p>
<p>Second, this relies on behind-the-scenes stuff happening correctly at class
   creation. It pretty much ties you to one class creation mechanism. If anyone tries to modify the class on after the fact, they'll have to know about those magic properties.  <br>
</p>

<h2>Just Too Complex</h2>
<p>Both those approaches are just too complex. They're hard to understand, hard to explain, and
   buggy in practice. They are, however the best solutions that top minds have
   come up with for implementing <code>super</code> starting from <code>this</code>. I certainly wasn't able to come up with anything nearly as good.  As a result, I seriously doubt there <em>is</em> a clean way to make this work. My conclusion would be simply
   &quot;don't do that.&quot;
</p>
<blockquote><p>A guy goes to a doctor and says, &quot;every time I lift my arm like this, I get a sharp pain.&quot; So the doctor says, &quot;don't do that.&quot;
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Hanging Super on the Class</h2>
<p>So, <code>super</code> behavior has to hang off the class.  We're all in agreement on
   that, right? The only remaining question is if we should reference the
   superclass directly, or go through our own class. If we just hard-code
   in the name of the superclass, it looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>return Wagon.prototype.drive.apply(this, arguments);
</code></pre><p>If on the other hand, we keep a reference to the superclass's prototype
   on the base class, say, <code>_super</code>, then we can write this:
</p>
<pre><code>return RickityWagon._super.drive.apply(this, arguments);
</code></pre><p>Not much difference, really, but some people prefer this so that it's
   easy to change the class later to have another base class. That's not a
   particularly common refactoring, in my experience, but it doesn't sound
   like a bad idea to configure the superclass in one place.
</p>
<p>So what's not wrong with this, I ask? It's not <em>unclear</em>, is it?  It's very, very clear.  If you understand
   <code>prototype</code>, and you understand <code>apply</code>, <code>this</code>, and <code>arguments</code>... it's just
   so painfully obvious and clear. Is it so ugly, then? To me, the baroque
   alternatives are a thousand times uglier.  Perhaps we should simply meditate on
   the lessons of this expression instead of trying to replace it with
   something barely more concise but opaque and fraught with hidden complexity.
   And if a beginner asks you what it means, perhaps you could encourage them to
   come to a deeper understanding of JavaScript by internalizing these
   fundamental concepts.
