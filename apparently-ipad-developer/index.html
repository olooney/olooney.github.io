<div>
  
<p>Last week my boss stopped by and dropped a brand spanking new iPad on my desk.
   &quot;Make our application work on this,&quot; he commanded.  &quot;You have two days before 
   we demo it at the trade show.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Madness? No, these are web apps!  You see, for the last couple years we've been
   working exclusively on AJAX applications: web pages stuffed with so much
   JavaScript they look and feel like desktop apps.  It's harder than writing
   desktop software, but if you pull it off you get an application that can be
   run anywhere, instantly.
</p>
<p>So, I'm not a &quot;real&quot; iPhone/iPad developer; I've never even seen the dev
   kit.  I just do web apps.  Although maybe &quot;just&quot; isn't the right word.  We had
   a 60,000 line application running on a completely new platform the same week it
   launched.
</p>
<p>Can your app do that?
</p>
<p>We already supported Safari, so you'd expect it to work on the iPad too... and it
   did, mostly, except for a couple of bugs.  Flipping the iPad on its side would
   mess up the layout, double clicks didn't work, stuff like that.  Here are the
   problems we hit, and what we did to solve them.
</p>

<h2>Browser Detect</h2>
<p>To fix a browser-specific JavaScript bug you need to know when you're on that
   browser.  Detecting the iPad is easy: the iPad user agent contains the unique 
   string &quot;iPad&quot;, so we checked for that.  <br>
</p>
<pre><code>// a function to parse the user agent string; useful for 
// detecting lots of browsers, not just the iPad.
function checkUserAgent(vs) {
    var pattern = new RegExp(vs, 'i');
    return !!pattern.test(navigator.userAgent);
}

if ( checkUserAgent('iPad') ) {
    // iPad specific stuff here
}
</code></pre><p>Simple enough.
</p>

<h2>Orientation Change</h2>
<p>Flipping the iPad would also mess up our layouts.  iPads use an accelerometer
   to detect if they're being held vertically or horizontally (or upside down.)
   From the browser's point of view it looks like the window was resized from
   1024x768 to 768x1024; and you get the normal window resize event you'd expect.
</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a>, and their <a href="http://www.extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/layout-browser/layout-browser.html">Layout framework</a> usually does a great 
   job handling the window resize event on normal browsers.  It knew that 
   <em>something</em> had happened but didn't recalculate all the sizes correctly.  (To
   be fair, we use some pretty complicated layouts.) 
   This is probably do to subtle timing issues or some such.  I didn't waste much 
   time figuring out what was going on, because there's a way to cut this Gordian 
   knot: the iPad specific <code>orientationchange</code> event.
</p>
<pre><code>window.onorientationchange = function() {
    alert(window.orientation);
}
</code></pre><p>window.orientation is one of 0, 90, -90, or 180.  0 and 180 are portrait; 90 and
   -90 are landscape.  The onorientationchange event fires whenever it changes.
   For us, it was sufficient to say <code>viewport.doLayout()</code> on orientation change;
   that gave <a href="http://extjs.com/">ExtJS</a> the hint it needed to get the sizes right.
</p>

<h2>Double Click</h2>
<p>Safari on the iPad co-opts the double click event for its own use (a local
   zoom.)  You can listen for the <code>dblclick</code> event in JavaScript... it just never 
   fires.  That was a bit of a problem, because we'd consistently allowed the user 
   to double click stuff (a row in a grid, for example) to jump to a more detailed view.
</p>
<p>We settled on a two finger touch gesture to emulate the double click: 
   touch an item in one place and tap it in another.  <br>
   <img class="small" src="/static/media/images/essay/double_tap.png" alt="Diagram of a two-finger simultaneous tap">
   Tapping with two figures
   simultaneously also works.  When I say emulate, I mean that literally: when
   we detect one of these double touches, we actually tell the DOM to fire a
   <code>dblclick</code> event.  That way, the solution worked everywhere and we
   didn't have to track down every single place we registered a dblclick
   listener.  <br>
</p>
<pre><code>document.body.addEventListener('touchstart', function(e) {
    touch = e.touches[0];
    if ( !touch ) return;
    var me = document.createEvent(&quot;MouseEvents&quot;);
    me.initMouseEvent('dblclick', true, true, window,
        1, // detail / mouse click count
        touch.screenX, 
        touch.screenY, 
        touch.clientX, 
        touch.clientY, 
        false, false, false, false, // key modifiers
        0, // primary mouse button
        null  // related target not used for dblclick event
    );
    touch.target.dispatchEvent(me);
});
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, this code is too simple.  You see, both the iPad and
   iPhone use &quot;two finger scrolling&quot; for scrollable regions (elements with CSS
   <code>overflow: scroll;</code>) within a website.
   <img class="small" src="/static/media/images/essay/double_scroll.png" alt="Diagram of a two-finger scroll">
   There's no way to turn this off, and it doesn't even show a scrollbar: it's 
   two finger scrolling or nothing.
</p>
<p>If you use the above code as is, the dblclick event will fire as soon as the
   user tries to use two finger scrolling.  We ran into this because we have grids
   with thousands of rows to scroll from where the user can double click a row to
   go to a detailed view.  To fix this problem, we had to make sure we only
   fired an emulated <code>dblclick</code> event if the user quickly double tapped a row, not
   if they pressed and dragged.  So instead we only set up a timer in the 
   <code>touchstart</code> event and actually fired the <code>dblclick</code> from <code>touchend</code>.  This 
   requires more code, but lets us handle &quot;double clicking&quot; inside of scrollable 
   regions.
</p>

<h2>Nitpicking</h2>
<p>Pretty much every reviewer has mentioned the iPad's &quot;gorgeous screen,&quot; but
   it's just a 1024x768 display at fairly low DPI, so I'm not sure what that's about.
   We test everything down to 800x600 so we were ok, usability-wise, but it sure 
   looks a lot better on a large monitor.
</p>
<p>We also embed Google maps, using them as backdrops to display geographic
   data, and the web experience for Google maps is somewhat diminished compared to
   the full fledged Google Maps iPad app.  They still work, though.
</p>
<p>Safari on the iPad and iPhone doesn't fire mouse events on elements it doesn't
   consider &quot;clickable&quot;.  Registering a <code>click</code> event listener, even if it doesn't
   do anything, will allow the element to receive the full set of mouse events.
</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>We made the two day deadline.
</p>
<p>Did it work?  Man, people were stopping by our booth just for the <em>chance</em>
   to touch an iPad.  This was less than two weeks after it launched;
   there was a lot of curiosity.  We use a bunch of data visualization like
   Google maps and charts, and it was just stunning.  It was like a thick, juicy 
   slice of future, served of a piece of future toast.  I can't say for sure it
   generated a sales lead, but it sure brought in some serious foot traffic.
</p>
<p>But what do you expect?  Web apps can and should run anywhere, even on stuff
   that hasn't been invented yet.

	<p>Hi Oran,

Great post, Got the rotation resize on our web-app running great. one note is that if you do not wish the alert to appear, but still want the window resized, it seems the javascript (will sometimes) still want a function, so a donothing() seemed to fix it. ( this behavior was very hard to replicate.

Alos would you be able to clarify if the doubleclick code you have given should work without modification (even if it causes issues with scrolling).  As we are unable to determine if it is a conflict with icefaces, or wether the code itself needs editing to work.

cheers for the great post</p>

	<p>Jeff - unfortunately that&#39;s proprietary code owned by the company I work for, and too complex to reproduce from scratch.  Most web pages don&#39;t use double clicks at all, and usually not in a nested scroll region.  So I hope the code in the article will be enough.
