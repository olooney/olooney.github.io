<div>
  
<p>I wrote this article in an unusual way:
   I started from the source code of a <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> module, commented it thoroughly,
   made some minor formatting changes, and fed it through the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> HTML
   expander.  The result is what I'd like to think is pretty good example
   of a <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">literate program</a>.  You can see the <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/static/python/phoneNormalizer.py">original</a> or <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/static/python/phoneNormalizer.html">formatted source code</a> too, or the <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/static/python/phoneNormalizer.txt">pre-markdown text file</a>, if you like.
</p>

<h2>phoneNormalizer.py</h2>
<p>The <code>phoneNormalizer</code> module demonstrates how a formatted string (a phone number is used
   as an example) can be divided into useful atomic parts without loss of
   information and without introducing dependencies for storage
   in a relational database.  In other words, it addresses issues of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">3NF</a> storage of
   data that is not trivially atomic.  The module is self testing, and it has been
   thoroughly documented in an attempt at <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">literate programming</a>.
</p>

<h2>Avoiding Dependent Columns</h2>
<p>Here's the problem: Storing the raw string phone number into a single text
   column in a database makes it un-searchable and unusable.  Storing only
   atomic fields (ZIP code, extension, etc.) throws away important information
   and makes handling edge cases like international numbers unnecessarily
   challenging.  However, storing both the raw string and the atomic fields
   introduces a dependency between columns (since the atomic fields can be
   computed from the raw string) which introduces the possibility of a
   corrupt database.
</p>
<p>Now, I can't imagine anyone would lose any sleep over these theoretical
   problems just for the case of phone numbers.  The problem is more general,
   and this module demonstrates a general technique.  The lesson here is to
   remember that it is ALWAYS possible to factor the atomic parts out of a
   complicated data type.  <br>
</p>

<h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
<p>The following snippet (copied from an interactive session) is included in the header
   string of the module.  But even though it's not code, it will be identified
   and parsed by <code>doctest</code>. <code>doctest</code> will run the 'commands' and validate the
   'output':
</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; normalize('work 123 (456)7890 x12 ')
('123', '456', '7890', '12', 'work %s (%s)%s x%s ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; reconstruct(_)
'work 123 (456)7890 x12 '
&gt;&gt;&gt; normalize('home 345-6789')
('', '345', '6789', '', 'home %s%s-%s%s')
&gt;&gt;&gt; reconstruct(_)
'home 345-6789'
</code></pre><p>Using <code>doctest</code> has two advantages: we can quickly create simple unit tests,
   and we provide documentation that is guaranteed to be accurate.  However,
   the testing is too simple to give us any real confidence in the functions.
   For that, we supply a 'luggage test' function that generates random
   phone numbers in an attempt to cover a large portion of the input space.
</p>
<p>The luggage test actually did catch a major bug: I forgot to escape the %
   characters when I first wrote the function.  That's great, but the unit testing actually performed a more 
   important service. I had to tweak the regular expressions several times
   to catch all the cases.  Each time I changed the regular
   expression, I couldn't be sure that the previous cases would continue
   to work.  However, I was able to tweak and massage the regular expression
   safely and easily, with the unit tests providing the safety net.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Unit tests enable painless refactoring.
</p>
</blockquote><p>There are two kinds of functions: those that are amenable to unit testing
   and those that are not.  I feel this distinction is important because it
   reminds us to factor the unit testable portion out and test it thoroughly.
   That way we can &quot;rely on reliable things.&quot;  As the non-unit-testable portion
   of our code shrinks and simplifies, human testing becomes more productive.
</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>
<p>First, we import the regular expression module, which we'll rely heavily on:
</p>
<pre><code>    import re
</code></pre><p>We'll need two regular expressions.  The first matches a phone number, with area code, including an optional extension:
</p>
<pre><code>    _phonePattern = re.compile(
        r'^(.*)(\d{3})(\D*)(\d{3})(\D*)(\d{4})(\D*)(\d*)(\D*)$'
    )
</code></pre><p>The second matches a local phone number (no area code) and optional extension:   <br>
</p>
<pre><code>    _localPhonePattern = re.compile(
        r'^(.*)()()(\d{3})(\D*)(\d{4})(\D*)(\d*)(\D*)$'
    )
</code></pre><p>These two regular expressions could be combined, but only at a tremendous cost
   is readability.  Note that the patterns are compiled just once, when the
   module loads.  The leading '_' is a <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> idiom indicating these are semi-
   private variables, and should not normally be used.
</p>

<h2>Seperate Atomic Fields from Formatting</h2>
<p><code>normalize()</code> is the essence of this module.  Notice that I chose to return
   a simple tuple, instead of defining a 'phone number' class.  It can be
   argued that every abstraction should be represented as a class, but
   I feel that a class should provide a significant service, and in this
   case it wouldn't do much more than group the data together.
</p>
<p>Using a tuple has the practical advantage of keeping the code
   simple.  I wanted the to take advantage of <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>'s built-in templating
   operator %.  The % operator can take either a tuple or a dictionary
   as the RHS.  I then chose the tuple over the dictionary because the
   components of a phone number come in a specific order, making it more
   tuple-like. Because the tuple really is the right logical choice, a
   lot of little things tended to work out; for example, the <code>repr()</code> of
   the tuple is quite readable.
</p>
<pre><code>def normalize(phoneNumber):
    'Maps a phone number in string format to (areaCode,trunk,branch,ext,form).'
    'assert: form % (areaCode,trunk,branch,ext) == phoneNumber'
</code></pre><p><code>form</code> is the original string with the identified atomic substrings
   factored out as '%s'.
   The assert statement is not validated by <code>doctest</code>--it's just a compact
   way to express a property that the return value will always have, even
   if the argument passed in isn't a recognized phone number.
</p>
<p>We'll try to match each pattern in turn:
</p>
<pre><code>    match = _phonePattern.match(phoneNumber)
    if not match: match = _localPhonePattern.match(phoneNumber)
</code></pre><p>If none of the patterns match, we'll return empty strings '' for
   each atomic field and append the four placeholders to the end of the raw pattern field
   so it may safely be <code>%</code>'ed with the 4-tuple of atomic fields:
</p>
<pre><code>    if not match: return ('','','','',phoneNumber.replace('%','%%') +('%s'*4))
</code></pre><p>Note that replacing '%'s with '%%'s escapes them from the % operator.  <br>
   Now that we have a regular expression match, we'll seperate out the atomic fields
   from the format.  We'll construct a a string containing all the non-phone number
   characters from the string with <code>%s</code> place-holders for the atomic fields:
</p>
<pre><code>    form = '%s'.join(tween.replace('%','%%') for tween in match.groups()[::2])
</code></pre><p>For example, &quot;work (%s)%s-%s x%s&quot;.  Note that here and below I use
   the <code>[::2]</code> slice operator.  This says take every other field.  So, I'm
   construct the form out the even groups, and the atomic fields are
   the odd groups:
</p>
<pre><code>    return match.groups()[1::2] + (form,)
</code></pre><p>So we see that normalize returns a 5-tuple: the four atomic fields and the form field at the end.
</p>
<p>Now that we're done with <code>normalize()</code>, it might be a good time to comment
   on <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>'s docstrings.  The first line of the docstring is considered
   special; it's what you'll see pop-up in an IDE while typing the function.
   the rest of the docstring is available in <code>__doc__</code>, but the first line
   should be self-sufficient for maximum clarity.  <code>#</code> comments (such as this paragraph)
   are even lower on the totem pole; they're 'private' comments that
   will only been seen by someone reading the code.
</p>

<h2>Reconstructing the Original String</h2>
<p>The entire point of this exercise is to separate the atomic information
   in a string from its formatting without duplication and without
   destroying information.  Therefore, it's important that we can retrieve the
   original input.  Note that if someone ran a conversion on the database,
   perhaps updating the ZIP code column, the reconstructed string would
   reflect the updated value.  This is not appropriate for all cases,
   such as when there's a legal reason to record the input as-is.
</p>
<pre><code>def reconstruct(phoneTuple):
    '(areaCode,trunk,branch,ext,form) -&gt; original formatted phone number'
    return phoneTuple[4] % phoneTuple[0:4]
</code></pre><p><code>reconstruct()</code> turns out to be a trivial function; our simple design
   is now paying dividends!
</p>

<h2>The Testing Framework</h2>
<p>We'll start by creating a single entry point for all unit testing of the module:
</p>
<pre><code>def _test():
    'test the module quietly and complain loudly on failure.'
    'the tests may take a few seconds to run.'

    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
</code></pre><p>I think <code>doctest</code> is a very nice <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> module.  Here, I'm simply
   validating the few basic tests in the module header above.
</p>
<pre><code>    _luggageTest(1000)
</code></pre><p>Again, notice the leading <code>_</code>, indicating semi-private functions.
</p>

<h2>The Old Luggage Test</h2>
<p><code>luggageTest()</code> builds strings composed of random digits and
   non-digits.  It handles the different formats that normalize
   accepts as separate cases.  It does not achieve complete
   coverage.  It merely tries to exercise a large number of
   variants on the known cases.
</p>
<pre><code>def _luggageTest(count):
    'tests against randomly generated phone numbers.'
</code></pre><p>To construct the strings, we need to be clear about what we mean by a
   digit and a non-digit.  The string module provides a string of digits,
   and we construct a string of non-digits from that.  We have to
   exclude the newline character because the regular expressions were
   not defined to be multiline, although doing so would not be difficult.
</p>
<pre><code>    from string import digits, printable
    nonDigits = ''.join(c for c in printable if c not in digits and c != '\n')
</code></pre><p>Next, we'll define helper functions for producing random strings.
   these are considered 'notation' and are therefore given short
   names; while it's true that you have to look up a few lines to
   figure out what each means, the string constructions below
   fit neatly onto a single line.
</p>
<pre><code>    import random
    def rD(count):  # r for random, D for regex non-digit
        return ''.join(random.choice(nonDigits) for i in range(count))

    def rd(count):  #r for random, D for regex digit
        return ''.join(random.choice(digits) for i in range(count))

    def rInt(count=3): #small random integer
        return random.randint(0,count)

    def rDdD(count=2): #string containing digits in the middle
        return rD(rInt(count)+1) + rd(rInt(count)) + rD(rInt(count)+1)
</code></pre><p>   <br>
   Now that we have all the tools we need, we'll exercise each known accepted format using the random string generators:
</p>
<pre><code>    for i in xrange(count):
        #with area code
        phoneNumber = rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(4) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(rInt()) + \
             rD(rInt())            
        _check(phoneNumber)

        #local
        phoneNumber = rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(4) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(rInt()) + \
             rD(rInt())            
        _check(phoneNumber)

        # area code, together
        phoneNumber = rD(rInt()) + rd(10) + rD(rInt())
        _check(phoneNumber)

        #local, together
        phoneNumber = rD(rInt()) + rd(7) + rD(rInt())
        _check(phoneNumber)

        # area code, scatter in some digits at the front.
        phoneNumber = rDdD() + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(4) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(rInt()) + \
             rD(rInt())            
        _check(phoneNumber)

        # local, scatter in some digits at the front.
        phoneNumber = rDdD() + \
             rd(3) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(4) + \
             rD(rInt()) + \
             rd(rInt()) + \
             rD(rInt()) 

        _check(phoneNumber)
</code></pre><p>We'll also test some cases where we know it is NOT a phone number.
   we will be able to reconstruct the original, but all the atomic
   fields will be empty strings:
</p>
<pre><code>    for i in xrange(count): # not a phone number
        string = rD(rInt()+5)
        norm = normalize(string)
        recon = reconstruct(norm)
        if ( recon != string ) or \
           ( norm[1] !='' ):
            print string
            print norm
            print
</code></pre><p>That's the end of <code>_luggageTest()</code>.  <br>
</p>

<h2>Checking Each Phone Number</h2>
<p>We still have to define this helper function:
</p>
<pre><code>def _check(phoneNumber):
    'Verifies that normalize() detects the atomic fields in the phone number.'
    norm = normalize(phoneNumber)
    recon = reconstruct(norm)
    if (recon != phoneNumber) or \
       (norm[1] == '') or \
       (norm[2] == ''):
        print phoneNumber
        print norm
        print recon
        print
</code></pre><p>And we're done with the testing framework.  All we need now is a convenient way to kick off the test.
   It's another <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> idiom to check the <code>__name__</code> to see if
   we're being run from the command line.  For modules that
   are meant to be imported into other <a href="http://python.org/">python</a> scripts, (as
   opposed to <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> command line scripts) it's common to
   use this check to self-test the module.  Here I've isolated the test
   code in _test(), which is my personal preference.
</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    _test()
</code></pre>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I've explored three concepts in this program: the 3NF problem that the
   module is designed to explore, the unit testing that made it possible
   to trust code depending heavily on a couple unreadable regular expressions,
   and the literate programming style of explaining the first two.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose I were to say the string was a regular expression. And suppose I were to say the string was unreadable.  But I repeat myself.
   - Mark Twain.
</p>
</blockquote><p>Python comes with a unit test framework that I did not use here, because
   it would not have helped me write the brute force <code>_luggageTest()</code> and I prefer
   the elegance of <code>doctest</code>.  <br>
</p>

<h2>Afterword</h2>
<p>I originally wrote this article as comments embedded in the source itself. I did have to apply a few transformations to get it into neatly formatted HTML, but I that only took a few minutes.  Proof-reading took longer, because comments tend to be terse labels, not perfect English.  I would say the results were reasonable.  If you compare the proof-reading changes in this document to the <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/static/python/phoneNormalizer.html">source code</a>, you'll see that I significantly changed the section structure to better fit the program.  It seems precise section and boundary formatting is needed to do proper <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">literate programming</a>.
